# Simple Syntax Formatter

This plugin is intended to be a very simple wrapper for vim's built-in
`formatexpr` and `formatprg` options, to provide easy-to-use integration with
external formatting tools, such as code formatters. It more straightforwardly
handles dynamic changes to the command line for the external code formatter
whilst integrating naturally with vim's inbuilt formatting approach.

Install the plugin using [any standard vim plugin
manager](https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/388/91), then type `:help
simple-syntax-formatting` for more information. Alternatively, you can see the
documentation
[here](https://github.com/andrewferrier/vim-simple-syntax-formatting/blob/master/doc/simple-syntax-formatting.txt).
